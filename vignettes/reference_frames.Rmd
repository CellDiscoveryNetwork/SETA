## Introduction

`SETA` provides a set of functions for compositional analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. In earlier vignettes, we introduced the basics of compositional transforms (`setaCLR`, `setaALR`, etc.) and distance/metadata handling. 

In this vignette, we demonstrate how to create and utilize _multi-resolution_ annotations—here referred to as **reference frames**—for hierarchical or subcompositional analysis. Our outline:

- **Extract a taxonomic data frame** of differing cell-type resolutions  
- **Visualize the taxonomy as a tree** using `ggraph`  
- **Transform counts data with a chosen taxonomic reference frame**  
- **Compare PCA latent spaces** based on different reference frames

This example works with the Tabula Muris Senis lung dataset which can be downloaded directly with bioconductor
It contains lung single-cell profiles from 14 donor mice (mouse_id). 
Each mouse is assigned to one of five age groups—from young adult to old—recorded in the age column. 
Standard cell-type labels (free_annotation) and additional metadata (e.g. sex) are also included.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(SETA)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(TabulaMurisSenisData)
```

```{r}
# Set up a color palette for plots
# 9-group distinct categoricals
d_palette <- c("#3B9AB2", "#6BAFAF", "#9BBDAC", "#C9C171",
               "#EBCC2A", "#E6A80F", "#E98903", "#F84C00", "#F21A00",
               "#B10026", "#67000D")
```

## Load and prepare data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sce <- TabulaMurisSenisDroplet(tissues = "Lung")$Lung

sce <- sce[, colData(sce)$subtissue != "immune-endo-depleted"]

sce$mouse.id <- gsub("/", "", sce$mouse.id)

```

Quick data exploration:

```{r}
table(sce$free_annotation, sce$age)
```

## Creating a Taxonomic Data Frame
Below, we define a custom lineage column that lumps certain cell types together:

All Monocyte variants → Monocytes

All CD4/CD8 variants → T cells

All B cell variants → B cells

Everything else remains as is.

```{r add lineage information}
# We'll make a small mapping from original free_annotation -> broader 'Lineage'
lineage_map <- c(
    "Adventitial Fibroblast" = "Fibroblast",
    "Airway Smooth Muscle" = "SMC",
    "Alveolar Epithelial Type 2" = "Epithelial",
    "Alveolar Fibroblast" = "Fibroblast",
    "Alveolar Macrophage" = "Myeloid",
    "Artery" = "Endothelial",
    "B" = "B cell",
    "Basophil" = "Granulocyte",
    "Ccr7+ Dendritic" = "Myeloid",
    "CD4+ T" = "T cell",
    "CD8+ T" = "T cell",
    "Capillary" = "Endothelial",
    "Capillary Aerocyte" = "Endothelial",
    "Ciliated" = "Epithelial",
    "Classical Monocyte" = "Myeloid",
    "Club" = "Epithelial",
    "Intermediate Monocyte" = "Myeloid",
    "Interstitial Macrophage" = "Myeloid",
    "Lympatic" = "Endothelial",
    "Ly6g5b+ T" = "T cell",
    "Myeloid Dendritic Type 1" = "Myeloid",
    "Myeloid Dendritic Type 2" = "Myeloid",
    "Myofibroblast" = "Fibroblast",
    "Natural Killer" = "NK",
    "Natural Killer T" = "NK",
    "Neuroendocrine" = "Neuroendocrine",
    "Neutrophil" = "Granulocyte",
    "Nonclassical Monocyte" = "Myeloid",
    "Pericyte" = "Endothelial",
    "Plasma" = "Plasma Cell",
    "Plasmacytoid Dendritic" = "Myeloid",
    "Proliferating Alveolar Macrophage" = "Proliferating",
    "Proliferating Classical Monocyte" = "Proliferating",
    "Proliferating Dendritic" = "Proliferating",
    "Proliferating NK" = "Proliferating",
    "Proliferating T" = "Proliferating",
    "Regulatory T" = "T cell",
    "Vein" = "Endothelial",
    "Zbtb32+ B" = "B cell"
)

# Add a new column in  named 'Lineage'
free_annotations <- as.character(sce$free_annotation)
sce$Lineage <- lineage_map[free_annotations]
```

Now we can build a taxonomic data frame that has two levels: 
the fine label (free_annotation) and the broad label (Lineage). 

```{r create taxonomy DF}
# In a Seurat Object, barcodes are in the rownames of the metadata.
# Similar to setaCounts, taxonomy DF creation can use rownames as bc.
# Then we ensure we have columns for 'free_annotation' and 'Lineage'.
print(head(sce$free_annotation))
print(head(sce$Lineage))

# We want a data frame that includes bc + 'free_annotation' + 'Lineage'
# Then we'll pass it to setaTaxonomyDF
tax_df <- setaTaxonomyDF(
    obj = data.frame(colData(sce)),
    resolution_cols = c("Lineage", "free_annotation"),
    bc_col = "cell"
)

# Each row is a unique 'free_annotation'.
# The last column 'free_annotation' is the finer label.
# cols must be entered in order of increasing resolution (broadest to finest)
tax_df
```

## Visualize the Taxonomy as a Tree via ggraph

We now have a 2-level taxonomy: free_annotation (fine) -> Lineage (coarse). 
For demonstration, let's build a small graph that connects each free_annotation node to its Lineage node. 
We'll color edges by the lineage label:

```{r ggraph, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
# Create a tidygraph object using SETA built-in utils

tbl_g <- taxonomy_to_tbl_graph(
    tax_df,
    columns = c("Lineage", "free_annotation"))

# Plot with ggraph
ggraph(tbl_g, layout = "dendrogram") +
    geom_edge_diagonal2(aes(color = node.Lineage)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(filter = leaf,
                       label = free_annotation, color = Lineage),
                   nudge_y = 0.1, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0, size = 5) +
    geom_node_text(aes(filter = !leaf,
                       label = Lineage),
                   color = 'black',
                   size = 5,
                   repel = TRUE) +
    guides(edge_colour = guide_legend(title = "Lineage"),
           color = guide_legend(title = "Lineage")) +
    theme_linedraw(base_size = 16) +
    scale_edge_color_manual(values = d_palette) +
    scale_color_manual(values = d_palette) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks = seq(0, 2, by = 1),
                    labels = c("Type", "Lineage", "Root")) +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
    expand_limits(y = -5) +
    coord_flip() +
    ggtitle("SETA: Taxonomy")
```

Here, each Lineage is a parent node, and each free_annotation is a leaf node.
The edges are colored by the lineage name.

## Taxonomic Balances with SETA

Balances can be calculated between clades and species among the taxonomic tree. 
Currently, SETA supports user-specified balances with the transform "balance",
where balances are calculated as log-ratios between these clades or species. 
The choice of numerator and denominator groups determine which direction the resulting
balance points. If the composition is weighted towards the numerator, the log-ratio
will be positive, and negative if towards the denominator. 

```{r}
# Create sample x free_annotation counts:
taxa_counts <- setaCounts(
    data.frame(colData(sce)),
    cell_type_col = "free_annotation",
    sample_col = "mouse.id",
    bc_col = "rownames"
)

# Create SETA sample-level metadata
meta_df <- setaMetadata(data.frame(colData(sce)), sample_col = "mouse.id",
                        meta_cols = c("age", "sex"))


bal_out <- setaTransform(
    counts     = taxa_counts,
    method     = "balance",
    balances   = list(
        epi_vs_myeloid = list(
            num   = "Epithelial",
            denom = "Myeloid"
        )
    ),
    taxonomyDF   = tax_df,
    taxonomy_col = "Lineage"
)

# merge the balances with sample-level metadata
bal_df <- data.frame(
    sample_id       = rownames(bal_out$counts),
    epi_vs_myeloid  = as.numeric(bal_out$counts[, "epi_vs_myeloid"]),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
) |>
    dplyr::left_join(meta_df, by = "sample_id")

# Compare age groups by epithelial to myeloid ratios
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(bal_df, aes(x = age, y = epi_vs_myeloid, fill = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.15, size = 2) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = d_palette) +
    labs(title = "Epithelial / Myeloid balance across age groups",
         y = "log GM(Epithelial) – log GM(Myeloid)",
         x = "Age (months)") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The y‑axis shows the log‑ratio of the geometric means of Epithelial versus
Myeloid counts for each mouse. Positive values indicate epithelial enrichment
relative to myeloid cells, while negative values indicate the opposite. Because
this is a standard log‑ratio, the statistic is fully compositional and can be
compared directly across groups.


## Transform Counts with a Taxonomic Reference Frame

We can now use setaCounts to get the sample × free_annotation matrix, 
then apply a within-lineage transform. 
This lumps certain columns (cell types) into subcompositions. 
For example, a CLR transform within each lineage:

```{r reference frame calculation}
# We'll transform them with a 'Lineage' grouping.
# The taxonomyDF uses rownames = free_annotation
# so that colnames(taxa_counts) align with rownames(tax_df).
refframe_out <- setaTransform(
    counts            = taxa_counts,
    method            = "CLR",
    taxonomyDF        = tax_df,
    taxonomy_col      = "Lineage",
    within_resolution = TRUE
)

refframe_out$within_resolution
refframe_out$grouping_var

# Compare to a standard global CLR transform:
global_out <- setaTransform(taxa_counts, method = "CLR")
```


## Visualize Latent Spaces With Different Reference Frames

Below we show how to do PCA on the sample-level coordinates from either the global CLR or the lineage-based CLR. 
We color points by age to see if the subcompositional approach changes clustering.

```{r latent reference frames, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
# A) Global CLR
latent_global <- setaLatent(global_out, method = "PCA", dims = 2)
pca_global <- latent_global$latentSpace
pca_global$sample_id <- rownames(pca_global)

# B) Within-Lineage CLR
latent_lineage <- setaLatent(refframe_out, method = "PCA", dims = 2)
pca_lineage <- latent_lineage$latentSpace
pca_lineage$sample_id <- rownames(pca_lineage)

# Merge with metadata
pca_global <- left_join(pca_global, meta_df)
pca_lineage <- left_join(pca_lineage, meta_df)

# Plot side by side
p1 <- ggplot(pca_global, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = age)) +
    geom_text(aes(label = sample_id)) +
    scale_color_manual(
        values = d_palette
    ) +
    labs(title = "Global CLR PCA",
         x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Age (Months)") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab(sprintf("PC1 (%s%%)",
                 signif(latent_global$varExplained[1], 4) * 100)) +
    ylab(sprintf("PC2 (%s%%)",
                 signif(latent_global$varExplained[2], 4) * 100)) +
    theme(legend.position = 'none')

p2 <- ggplot(pca_lineage, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = age)) +
    geom_text(aes(label = sample_id)) +
    scale_color_manual(
        values = d_palette
    ) +
    labs(title = "Within-Lineage CLR PCA",
         x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Age (Months)") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab(sprintf("PC1 (%s%%)",
                 signif(latent_lineage$varExplained[1], 4) * 100)) +
    ylab(sprintf("PC2 (%s%%)",
                 signif(latent_lineage$varExplained[2], 4) * 100))


p1 + p2
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
